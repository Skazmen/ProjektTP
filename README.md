# Basic Rules
Go is an strategy board game for two players, where the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent.
The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day.
Players have black or white stones, and place them at line crossings. When player surrounds another player, the surronded player stones are taken from the board.
